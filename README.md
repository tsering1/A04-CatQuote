# CatQuote

This project uses two APIs, the Cat API and the Quotes API by API Ninjas. Only the Quote API requires an API key, but I've gone ahead and left mine so that you can use the application immediately. If this is bad practice, my bad.

The intended use of this site should be to grab a cute cat image with an inspiring quote, randomly generated at the press of two buttons. Not all cats will be cute and not all quotes will be that inspiring, but if you're able to, keep clicking until you get a super serious quote and a super goofy cat. It's more fun that way.

Enjoy!
